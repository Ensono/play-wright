Following repo is a POC into playwright

Playwright is a Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API. Playwright is built to enable cross-browser web automation that is evergreen, capable, reliable, and fast. Because Microsoft Edge is built on the open-source Chromium web platform, Playwright is also able to automate Microsoft Edge.

Playwright launches headless browsers by default. Headless browsers don't display a UI, so instead you must use the command line. You can also configure Playwright to run full (non-headless) Microsoft Edge as well.

Following POC outlines multpie features provided by Playwright such as

Readable assertions
Visual Regression
Accessability testing
Connecting to browserstack and publishing tests to browserstack
Running parrell tests
Running on multiple browsers, os and mobile devices
Starting an API then running playwright tests
